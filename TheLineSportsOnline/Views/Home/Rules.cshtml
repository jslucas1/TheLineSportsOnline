<h2>The SWAMI RULES</h2>

<h3 class="bg-primary">Object</h3>
<p>
    It's simple. Each player starts the season with a mythical $1000. The player
    with the most moola after the bowl games is deemed the 'Swami'. This year, the
    season will start September 2nd, and run every week there are a full slate of
    games through “bowl week”.
</p>

<br />
<h3 class="bg-primary">Rules</h3>
<p>
    Every Tuesday morning, 16 games will be chosen from an online site (ESPN’s Daily
    line from the Mirage). The games and the 'opening lines' will be sent via email
    to all the players. These lines are subject to change, due to injuries and the
    like. On Thursday, final lines will be distributed. These are the official lines
    used to place your bets. All bets for the week must be in by 12pm EST on Friday.
    Occasionally there is a worthwhile Thursday night game. If it is a selected game
    and you choose to bet on it, ALL your bets for the week must be in by Thursday 4pm.
    Here's a sample of what you'd receive:

<p>
    You would send me an email with the team name that you think will cover and the
    dollar amount you would like to wager. In the above example, I would send an email
    that said Bama $500, and Northwood $500. I would be betting $1000 for the week,
    picking Alabama to beat Auburn by more than 27 points and Northwood to win or not
    lose by more than 5 points. If a game is listed as 'NL' (no line) on Thursday, you
    cannot bet on the game. Example: Florida State decides to kick a QB off the team
    for stealing crablegs, more than likely, the line will go to NL.. A line of 'even'
    translates into “pick the winner”.
</p>

<br />
<p>
    You can bet on as many/few games as you like. All bets must be in multiples of $10.
    <span style="font-weight:900;  text-decoration:underline;">
        If you have positive earnings going into the week, your minimum bet is 1/2 of your
        current monies.
    </span>
    Example: At the start of the season, we all begin the first week
    with $1000. We all must bet at least $500 that week. This ensures that someone doesn't
    take a gamble the first few weeks and then decides to sit on his/her earnings.
</p>

<br />
<p>
    <span style="font-weight:900;  text-decoration:underline;">
        If you go in the hole >= $1000, You’re OUT
    </span>
    (and probably a bad credit risk too).
    <span style="font-weight:900; color:Crimson;">
        If you go into negative earnings, the most you can bet is what will get you back
        to your original $1000.
    </span>
    Here's a 'true life' example: Tommy Fike goes into the hole $500. The most he can bet
    the next week is $1500.
    <span style="font-weight:900; color:Crimson; ">
        If you have a positive balance, your maximum bet is the amount that will put you
        out of the game, - 1000.
    </span>
</p>

<br />
<p>
    <span style="font-weight:900;  text-decoration:underline;">
        If you fail to turn in your bets, that week your minimum bid will be placed on the Favorite
        with the largest line.
    </span>
    Example: Marc decides to get married over a football weekend (not very smart) and does not 
    turn in his wagers. He currently has $2000. From the above table, he would automatically 
    have a $1000 bet on Alabama (he's a lucky guy). You can turn in your bets anytime after you
    receive the first email on Tuesday.
    <span style="font-weight:900;  text-decoration:underline;">
        Once they are in, you cannot change them.
    </span>
    Remember    that these lines could change between Tuesday and Thursday, so if you turn in a 
    bet of $500 on Tuesday and the line changes, you’re stuck with the new line (can move in 
    your favor too). If the line moves to NL, the bet is cancelled.
